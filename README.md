# Alexa Developer Toolbelt / CLI Reference

The Alexa Developer Toolbelt is an Alexa skill built to assist developers who may frequently use the command line, and just as frequently forget how to use the command line.

Case in point:

The Developer Toolbelt stores man pages and provides the ability to search their contents through Alexa, allowing you to ask questions like:

- _What does the `tmux` command do?_
- _What does the `rebase` option of the `git` command do?_
- _What option shows hidden files in the `ls` command?_
- _Who wrote the `echo` command?_

...but it's still very much a work-in-progress!
